==========

Summary:
You are a code breaker who needs to crack the secret code created by Dr. Random. Because Dr. Random isnt all that evil, he decided he was going to be generous and help>you try to break to code by giving you clues. The code is comprised of 5 numbers ranging from 0-6. You will have  10 tries in order to guess the code. If you guess the>correct number in the correct position, the Dr. will let you know but he wont tell you which number is correct. If you guess the correct number but in the wrong position, the Dr. will tell you but he wont tell you which number is correct. From these helpful hints, you should be able to deduce the code using your super code breaker skills! Good luck! To run this code all you need to do is: 
$ make
$ ./Mastermind

Description: There is a randomly generated array of characters chosen from a set character lit: 0123456. This character array acts as the secret code that the user needs to guess from the clues provided. The users guess will then be compared to the secret code and then the clues will be output to the user. From those clues the user should change their guess each time and in 10 tries, should be able to guess the code. This code is written in accordance with the Unix design philosophy, specifically with the Rule of Modularity because we are using functions to do smaller tasks that come together for the entire project. Also, we are using the Rule of Simplicity because the code is very basic and easy for other people to understand.
